# CO5222-Databases-II-

We were given a scenario in which a store has three different databases which were produced by three different pieces of software. 
We were hired by the store owner to collate this data into a single data warehouse for the purpose of OLAP.

RESPONSABILITIES

- Design a data warehouse based around the store owner's needs in the format of a Star or Snowflake schema.
- Create an Operational Data Store (ODS) in Python that matches the Star/Snowfalke data warehouse.
- Load all data from the file provided ("Script.sql") into an SQL database using SQL Server Management Studio and 
  write a Python class that will extract all the data from the SQL Server database generated by "Script.sql" into the
  Operational Data Store (ODS).
- Create a Python class that will read in the data values from the CSV file ("SalesCSV") and upload them into your Operational Data Store.
- Add a class to the Python program that will read in the JSON data values ("SalesJSON") and upload them to you Operational Data Store.
- Create an empty SQL database and export all the data from ODS into the database.
- Build a main class that executes everything all at once.
